## Contributing In General
Our project welcomes external contributions! If you have an itch, please feel free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a pull request to the [GitHub repository](https://github.ibm.com/StockTrader/notification-twitter).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.ibm.com/StockTrader/notification-twitter/issues). Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly [get in touch](#communication) with us.

**We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in the queue for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.ibm.com/StockTrader/notification-twitter/issues) before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed.
This is to avoid you spending your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers are not willing to accept into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.ibm.com/StockTrader/notification-twitter/issues) before sending a pull request so it can be discussed.
If the fix is trivial or non controversial then this is not usually necessary.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code review to
indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the maintainers of each
component affected.

For more details, see the [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS.md) page.
